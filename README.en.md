# geneHapR

## 1 Introduction

The gene haplotype were generated through vcf file.

Haplotype analysis was performed based on the genotype information of a large number of populations obtained by next-generation sequencing. Combined with phenotypic data to screen out excellent haplotypes for follow-up research geneHapR

## 2. Basic logic

1.  Import user's datasets (vcf data, GFF annotations, phenotype data)
2.  Calculate haplotype through vcf file and generate haplotype data
3.  The haplotype data were then combined with the annotation information to mark the variant sites on the gene diagram; and show the evolutionary relationship between the haplotypes
4.  Compare phenotypic differences between different haplotypes and screen for dominant haplotypes

## 3. Installation Tutorial

**Notice:** To avoid unnecessary installation problems:

-   It is recommended to use the latest version of R(\>= 4.2.1)and Rtools4.2 for Windows 10 and above

-   It is recommended to use R(= 4.1.3)and Rtools4.0 for Windows7 system(due to system differences, the dependent Packages may not be installed normally)

### 3.1 Installation preparation

-   [ ] Install Rtools software
-   [ ] Install git software
-   [ ] Install R packages: `devtools`, `BiocManager`

### 3.2 geneHapR automatic installation method

``` r
# auto install command
# 1. Choose to install from gitee(domestic code hosting platform)
# Note: This method needs to install Rtools and Git first
devtools :: install_git("https://gitee.com/zhangrenl/geneHapR")

# 2. Choose to install from github
devtools :: install_github("zhangrenl/geneHapR")
```

### 3.3 geneHapR manual installation

``` r
# If the installation of the above command fails, you can go to Gitee to download the precompiled R package and select local installation
# Note the latest version was not promised by this way.
# Before installing geneHapR locally, you need to manually install the dependent R packages:
install.packages("BiocManager")
library(BiocManager)
install(c("ggpubr", "vcfR", "tidyverse", "stringr", "reshape2", "randomcoloR",
          "rtracklayer", "trackViewer", "GenomicRanges", "IRanges"))
```

## 4. How to use

### 4.1 Package Testing

``` r
library(geneHapR)
data("quickHap_test")
hap <- get_hap(vcf, hyb_remove = TRUE, na.drop = TRUE)
hapResult <- hap_result(hap)
plotHapTable(hapResult)
plotHapTable(hapResult)
hapVsPheno(hap = hap, pheno = pheno, phenoName = "GrainWeight.2021", minAcc = 3)
phenoResult <- hapVsPheno(hap = hap,
                      pheno = pheno,
                      phenoName = "GrainWeight.2021",
                      minAcc = 3,
                      mergeFigs = TRUE)
plot(phenoResult$figs)
```

### 4.2 Software usage

``` r
# Load geneHapR
library(geneHapR)
data("quickHap_test")# Load test data, you don't have to execute this line when processing your own data

# set working directory
setwd("/your/working/directory")

# Import DataSets
vcf = import_vcf("YourVcfFile")
gff = import_gff("YourGffFile")
phenos = import_pheno("YourPhenoFile")
